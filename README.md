# Shapes

To run the app, import the project into Android Studio and run. 
Alternatively, just push the apk in the root directory to the device.

This is currently a WIP game, so expect MANY bugs and issues.

Essentially you tap a cell in the grid, and the cells adjacent (above, below, left and right) all match the color of the tapped cell.
All cells that are adjacent with the same color pop off the grid, and the grid shifts down.

Currently, there is no animation in the game so clearing cells is a bit confusing to the user.
The resolution independence code isn't finished, so the game may appear off center on some devices. (As I mentioned this is VERY WIP code!)
